CaptureTheFlag
==============

Capture the Flag itâ€™s an urban game which is based on the idea that two opposing teams (e.g. red and blue) compete each other. Main objective is to capture other team's flag and bring it back to own base. This project brings it to another level and introduces it to virtual world, while players would still move in the real world. All players will be exploring the whole city (it doesn't matter what kind of city it is) with smartphones in their hands trying to locate other team's base and steal the flag.
