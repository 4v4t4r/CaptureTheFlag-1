            Someone of you has heard something about an outdoor game like ‘Capture the Flag’ and someone hasn't yet.
            In couple of words, I want bring closer this topic. It will be based on the idea that two opposing teams
            (e.g. red and blue) compete each other. Main objective is to capture other team's flag and bring it back
            to own base. I think it's a good idea that we can bring it to another level and introduce it to virtual world,
            while players would still move in the real world. All players will be exploring the whole city (it doesn't
            matter what kind of city it is) with mobile phones in their hands trying to locate other team's base
            and steal the flag.

            In BLStream we work together on this project as a guild team. It’s an open guild, not only for Python freaks
            (as we are ;-), but it is an across platform community with one
            common purpose - ‘Capture the Flag’ as an urban game for mobile phones. It’s an open source project and all
            source code you can find on GitHub and everyone can join us (including people from outside the company).
            <br><br>
            So if you want to join and start your adventure with Python, mobile phones and urban games
            please contact with <a href="mailto:michal.krawczak@blstream.com">Michał Krawczak</a>.
